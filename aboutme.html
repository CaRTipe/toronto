          Welcome to my corner of the world where fashion isn't just about
          <br />
          clothing—it's about expression. This page is for those who dare to
          break <br />
          the rules and challenge the norm. I curate unique looks that blend
          <br />
          boldness with subtlety, chaos with calm. Every piece has a story,
          every <br />
          outfit is a statement. Join me on this journey of self-expression
          <br />
          through fashion, and let's set our own trends
        </p>
        <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; font-size: 40px;">
          <h1>THREADS OF TORONTO</h1>
        </div>
        <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; justify-content: start; font-size: 40px; align-items: center; gap: 40px;">
          <p>
            In Nakuru's heart, where the streets pulse with <br>
            energy and sunsets paint the sky gold, lives a boy who speaks through <br>
            style. Toronto doesn't just wear clothes—he tells stories. Each <br>
            outfit is a feeling. A moment. A mood. One day calm in crisp whites, <br>
            the next loud in vintage fire. He hunts for pieces others miss and <br>
            brings them to life—because fashion, to him, isn't about being seen. <br>
            It's about being understood. He doesn't follow trends. He curves them. <br>
            And even in silence, the world notices.
